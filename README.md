**Challenge(s) addressed **
How can we address the high crime rate in Memphis Tennessee
How are we using education to address the problem. 

**Project Description**
ConnectEd is a web based application designed to  help the South Memphis community by addressing the high crime rate issues.
Our solution will provide a quick and coordinated response to student needs through an all-hands-on-deck approach, creating a continuous chain of government
 and social assistance aimed at reducing low education rates and breaking the school-to-crime pipeline in South Memphis.
 
**Project Value**
ConnectED is a high value solution because it increases the education rates whilst addressing the major issue in Memphis which is the high crime rate. 
This solution utilizes less startup capital as it utilizes the free services provided by the government and non profit organiations thereby giving us a high ROI with a profit margin of approximately 25%. 
 
**Tech Overview**
Frontend : HTML, CSS and JavaScript
Backend: Express.js(language), Node.js(framework)
AI Intergration:  Google Gemini API
Deployment: Github
 
**Overview of steps**
Canvas and Power Campus API provide the academic perfomance data from the school database
Our browser or client side send an API request to our backend or server side
The server side has API end points that receive this data and send it to the AI tool(Google Gemini ) 
The AI processes and analyzes the data based on our indicators that is the course grade average, attendance and the Tennessee Comprehensive Assesment Program(TCAP) ranges
Once the data is analyzed, the data is send to the frontend and displayed on the dashboard
The backend does another process that will determine what courses need more attention
The user(counselor) interacts with the student and enters the student's needs in the Gemini Chatbot
The Gemini chatbot sends the data back to the backend where it is analyzed by the Google Gemini 
The backend produces the resources that the student could utilize to address their problem based on the user's(counselor) feedback
That data is sent back to the frontend and displayed to the user(counselor) so they can provide the resources to the user.
